UW-Stout CS145 group project of Blackjack. Authors: Carter Close, Luke Kedrowski 

Inside the "src" folder is all of the .java (or .class files, I don't remember which one it uses), the one JavaFX class has special settings required to run it on IntelliJ, so ymmv with that (it's the Blackjack.java file). 
Do whatever you want for it, if you want to create a pull request go for it, copy/paste, download, literally whatever. Have fun with it, let me know if there's anything wrong with it.
